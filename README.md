Multitaskor
===========

About
-----
Multitaskor is a simple game made in 48 hours for the Ludum Dare 27. The theme for this edition of Ludum Dare was "10 Seconds". As so, Multitaskor features several mini arcade games and the player will play each stage for 10 seconds only. Further on, a stage will consist of two games at the very time using a split-screen feature.

How to play
-----------
The controls for Multitaskor are very simple and are mostly just the right/left and up/down arrow keys. Besides these, the "space bar" is also used in one of the mini games. However, the controls should be fairly attainable from the game itself which displays the keys to use in each mini game.

Technology
----------
To play the game, you'll need a modern browser. Multitaskor is a HTML5 game written in Javascript using the [Pentagine](https://github.com/davidgomes/pentagine) framework.
